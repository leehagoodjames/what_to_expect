### [The Complete Pregnancy Checklist: A Month-By-Month Guide](https://www.mustelausa.com/blogs/mustela-mag/pregnancy-checklist)
* Make an appointment with your OBGYN to verify that you’re pregnant and to make sure that the pregnancy appears normal.
* Take a look at your insurance plan to understand what prenatal care is covered.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40045512/181926539-daa8d9e4-cb27-459f-b98a-74ac902c7fe8.png)
* Start keeping a baby diary! You’re definitely going to have a variety of emotions, and you may want to write some of them down. It will be fun to look back on this later.
Adjust your diet. You’ll need nutrients for two now, so you should eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Make sure to drink plenty of water, too!
Quit smoking and drinking alcohol. We know it’s not as fun but it’s definitely best for your baby.
Exercise regularly. You don’t need to do anything strenuous, but make sure you’re getting light exercise at least three times per week.
Take folic acid supplements. They have been proven to greatly reduce the risk of some birth defects.
Rest! Remember that you’ll be exhausted in the early stages of your pregnancy, so make sure to get plenty of sleep whenever you can. It’s OK if you aren’t as productive as you used to be!
If you’re dealing with morning sickness, use ginger to settle your stomach and eat small, frequent meals.
Schedule your prenatal tests. This is a crucial part of your pregnancy checklist! Doctors are busy, so it’s best to make your appointments in advance. Talk to your doctor to find out what prenatal test schedule they recommend.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40045512/181926653-a54f4b09-11f9-4619-972e-d8f42901dbe6.png)
